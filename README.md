A revolutionary anti-human CAPTCHA system to protect your services from trouble

There seems to be a surprising lack of products designed to ensure the security of robot-only services. Doesn't anyone want to make sure those pesky humans don't start creating spam accounts on their shiny brand-new site? revCAPTCHA solves this issue by being (assuredly) the first CAPTCHA service with challenges designed NOT to let humans in, while being realistically accomplished by our fellow robots.
